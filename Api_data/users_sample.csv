322,933940,ED SPACE,None,None,None,"ED SPACE is a Swedish American dance music producer. His music is anthemic and often composed of driving basslines, dreamy vocals, melodic synths, and atmospheric space sounds that unearth feelings of euphoria and nostalgia.

His latest remix https://soundcloud.com/edspacemusic/365-remix is the latest expression of the ED SPACE sound, combining the euphoric hard dance style from his first remix https://soundcloud.com/edspacemusic/clubringer-sound-of-my-dream-remix, with his aggressive mid-tempo bass style from https://soundcloud.com/edspacemusic/sigma.

--------------------------------
Lê Gia Huy, better known as BÔN (bonpaul), is a 17-year-old electronic/dance music producer from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. He first entered the music scene at the age of 15 with his first release ""Anata Wa"" via ULMTD (a division of Diversity Recordings). Follow up the journey, BÔN has stopped making remixes to focus on producing good, quality original mixes which have given him an opportunity to appear on quality record labels such as Diversity, UXN, and RioX. 2020 marked a boom year for BÔN, as ""If You Love Me"", ""Full Control"" and ""All I Want"" were added to Spotify's Electro Mix, bringing his music way closer to audiences from around the world.

453,188998,Erased Tapes,Erased,Tapes,Erased Tapes,"Founded by sonic architect and explorer Robert Raths aka ghostworker in 2007, Erased Tapes is a truly independent record label that has disrupted the industry and rejuvenated the musical landscape. The London-based label has consistently nurtured genre-defying artists from all around the world without losing its avant-garde ethos.

2015 saw BBC 6 Music radio presenter Mary Anne Hobbs stage an Erased Tapes evening featuring Nils Frahm and A Winged Victory For The Sullen at the Royal Albert Hall as part of the prestigious BBC Prom. It was the fastest selling ticket of the entire season. Shortly after Erased Tapes was awarded Best Small Label 2015 at the AIM Awards.

On February 5th 2017 Erased Tapes opened the doors to its new East London home, marking the 10th anniversary by introducing fans and the public to the new Erased Tapes Sound Gallery.

“Ten years of one of the most important record labels of the last few years“ — Gilles Peterson

""Over the last decade, Robert Raths’ label Erased Tapes has developed a sonic profile perfectly in step with the growing taste for quiet, meditative works on the cusp of ambient and chamber music"" — The Independent

Multi-platinum record selling musician and record producer, Glenn Morrison is the archetype of the modern DJ/producer star. The 34-year-old Toronto native is as happy rocking an underground house party as he is performing at an exclusive oceanic rooftop venue; as adept at composing an international club anthem like ‘Contact’ as he is at concocting a pop dance record that strikes to the Billboard Charts in America.  His single ‘Goodbye’ has been Certified Double Platinum and went Number 1 for 11 weeks in a row on the Canadian Billboard Chart, as well as going Number 1 in Russia’s Billboard Chart.  It wound up taking over Eastern Europe and became Number 1 in 7 Countries to date.

He is signed to Sony Records, Universal Music Group and Sony Music ATV as a writer, producer, & recording artist. He has been nominated for several Juno Awards in 2015, as well as Fans Choice Award / Dance Artist of the Year / Dance Record of the Year for Sirius XM Radio Music Awards, and won the SOCAN Dance Record of the Year 2015. 

Glenn has enjoyed the support of DJs as varied as John Digweed and Pete Tong to Dixon and Solomun. For three years he was resident at Ibiza’s Amnesia Club, and was a resident at Space in Ibiza for 1 year, as well as Space in Miami for 2 years.  Last year, Glenn added the latest addition to his residency repertoire in his monthly night being held in Las Vegas at the acclaimed Moon Nightclub at the Palms Casino.  And he is perfecting a sinuous, hooky sound that combines the eerie beauty of pure techno with light rains of melody and flashes of emotion.

In short, Glenn Morrison is one of the most dynamic and accomplished talents in electronic music today. Period.

Morrison is a difficult DJ to pigeonhole and that’s what makes him such a fascinating talent. One minute his sound is ruthlessly minimal and funky; the next it’s washed in color and vocals and emotion.

Glenn has had an unusual career path. He started off as a classical pianist, a preteen prodigy, performing  – and winning – competitions. Then came a life-changing encounter with electronic music.

Production continues apace in the new mastering studio Morrison has built in Toronto, entitled Alpine Mastering (www.alpinemastering.com). Be it sound design for video game companies like Nintendo, EA Sports, Activision or Rockstar, or his own productions, he simply doesn’t stop making and playing music.  His latest partnership with IMAX has been a thrilling experience, pushing the boundaries of electronic music to that of sound-scoring live theatre visuals.  Glenn & IMAX unveiled this concept with a 3 part show series at the 2012 ComicCon event held at the Ruben H Fleet Science Centre in San Diego, and it was a huge success. “It’s been a liberating transition for me to make music for all different stylistic purposes, and I’m very grateful for having the ability to do what I love for a living” says Glenn.

Watch this brilliant artist over the course of 2021 as he will be reshaping and redefining how we perceive electronic music through an ample amount of live shows, performances, and recordings.

In the first ten years of his career Francesco has been able to collect a substantial list of wide-ranging achievements: from conducting his own music in the legendary Abbey Road Studios in London to releasing an impressive number of albums as a solo artist; scoring movies and documentaries to directing award-winning short films.

Francesco’s work ethic is second to none, but his greatest asset is, undoubtedly, his unconditional love for film: having a bachelor’s degree in Film Technology and a burning desire to create stories that will stand the test of time.

Drawn to simplicity and driven by a fanatical attention to detail, Francesco creates music that blurs the lines between ambient, electronic and orchestral.

His instinctive use of acoustic instruments combines the elegance of traditional orchestration with complex, electronic landscapes, melding into emotive and exquisitely elegant hybrid-orchestral compositions.

Francesco’s music takes listeners on a passionate journey through images and emotions, creating stories and shaping memories.",None,London,None,1783,1694,142,118,https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000471936981-q8euw7-large.jpg,None,16,None,2019-12-02T10:20:44Z,2012-04-21T09:30:15Z

While focussing predominantly on crossover ambient styles, we try not to limit ourselves to any one genre. Listening to our music is the best way to get to know us!

Our music is frequently used in TV and film productions, regularly receives international radio airplay and has been featured in several highly regarded printed publications and online magazines. We're extremely lucky to have a loyal and exacting fan base, many of whom have been following our output since day one.

Our aim since then has remained the same, to call attention to music that we think is deserving of your time. We're excited by advancements in technology and how they can facilitate new ways to enjoy music and video. In 2005 we were distributing music digitally in MP3 format before it was seen as a financial opportunity by the music industry at large. We love the internet for the creative freedom it allows and the connections it's helped us make.

The name Serein was taken from a meteorological dictionary, it is used to describe 'fine rain falling from a clear sky after sunset'. We pronounce it seh-rain, you can say it however you want.

What are binaural beats?
Binaural beats, or binaural tones, are auditory processing artifacts, or apparent sounds, caused by specific physical stimuli. This effect was discovered in 1839 by Heinrich Wilhelm Doveand earned greater public awareness in the late 20th century based on claims coming from the alternative medicine community that binaural beats could help induce relaxation, meditation, creativity and other desirable mental states. The effect on the brainwaves depends on the difference in frequencies of each tone: for example, if 300 Hz was played in one ear and 310 in the other, then the binaural beat would have a frequency of 10 Hz.
What are isochronic tones?
Isochronic tones are regular beats of a single tone that are used alongside monaural beats and binaural beats in the process called brainwave entrainment. At its simplest level, an isochronic tone is a tone that is being turned on and off rapidly. They create sharp, distinctive pulses of sound. Isochronic tones differ from binaural beats in that they use a single tone, not two. Isochronic tones are usually incorporated or disguised with music, as the undisguised tones can be unpleasant.",None,None,AU,1666,None,None,5,https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000177171233-twj4be-large.jpg,None,None,None,2015-09-18T01:57:46Z,2014-05-28T06:45:30Z

Ahmet was born in Kardjali, Bulgaria where he spent his childhood. His introduction into music came from his father's obsession with electronic equipment. At 10 years old Ahmet was so curious about how the electronic equipment worked that he began assembling and disassembling some parts of the electronic goods in his house. At the age of 12 Ahmet made his first steps in his music career by making his own remixes which showed his passion for music. In 1991 Ahmet's family decided to move to Turkey; that was the beginning of a whole new life for him. 
 
He was going to school in Izmir, one of the biggest cities in Turkey, and in the evenings Ahmet was working in some ordinary bars as a DJ. After graduating in 1995 Ahmet decided to continue his professional music career and started working as a resident DJ in one of the biggest clubs in Izmir called ""Club Marina"". Later Ahmet wanted to make a difference in his life and continued his music career in different cities in the world working as a DJ in successful parties and organizations. According to topdeejays.com in Turkey Ahmet became the #1 DJ in ""DEEP HOUSE"",  #1 DJ with the most followers in YouTube and multiple times #1 on Beatport Mixes

Sam Feldt & Möwe feat. Karra - Down For Anything - OUT NOW
sptfy.com/Edy
 
This Austrian deep house & indie pop duo have rapidly risen the ranks, stealing music hearts across the globe. Racking up a colossal 100 Million+ streams across multiple platforms, boasting 4 million Spotify listeners across 61 countries, and enticing fans by showing off their phenomenal DJ and Live PA performances at 100,000 crowd strong events such as Pride Vienna, and iconic venues and locations such as Ushuaïa Ibiza, Amsterdam Dance Event, Nos Trilhos Sao Paulo, Pacha Germany and BadenFahrt Festival Switzerland to name a few. 

Möwe was founded by members Clemens Martinuzzi and Melanie Ebietoma in 2013. Now in their mid 20’s and both music aficionados from the start, the two met while they were playing in Indie Rockbands; “Mary lost her Pathos” and “At Pavillon”. They quickly realised that their music stylings matched incredibly well, and began creating music together! First inspired by a bitter cold winter day in Vienna and their longing for something to bring them warmth and a high spirited feeling, they decided to create their new sound, which was the birth of Möwe. The rest, as they say, is history…

The unique duo released their first official track together in 2014 on Stil Vor Talent – the label of Oliver Koletzki. They then began developing their own distinct sound and style, bringing tunes like Blauer Tag (2013, 6 Million Streams), Sonnenkind (2014, 12 Million Streams), Birds flying high (2015, 17 Million Streams), and Lovers Friends (2016, 17 Million Streams). Their debut album ""Back in the Summer"" was released in 2016, which welcomed huge fan and notable DJ support. They have also had tremendous success on many of their single tracks, one of the most notable being Skyline in 2017, which has pulled in 10 Million+ streams and radio play worldwide including on the US taste makers station Sirius XM. 

They have stellar taste in labels, and have worked in tandem with Universal Music, Atlantic Records, Ministry of Sound, Big Beat, Armada Music, Ultra Music, Spinnin’ records and the powerhouse that is Discowax Sony worldwide. Among other interesting facts, they are extremely proud of their singing prowess, the fact that they both play guitar and bass, and that they both play keys. This impressive show of musicianship is just one of the reasons their live shows are a unique wow factor for the fans and are not to be missed! Showing no signs of slowing down for 2018, Möwe are bringing a stack full of new music including a collaboration with Sam Feldt, while also continuing to entertain fans with their live PA performances across the glove and Möwe’s Flying High Radio Show expanding to new levels. This duo is clearly a force to be reckoned with, and without question, they are artists to watch!",True,Vienna,AT,129794,2,100,107,https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000319755738-d2guee-large.jpg,None,16,None,2021-07-06T17:00:16Z,2013-01-07T20:16:52Z

✖✖✖ BIO ✖✖✖

Reaching more than one million of clicks per month just on Soundcloud, Vijay & Sofia Zlatko attain massive stats for an underground artist. It must say that the Belgium duet didn't steal this success! From their remixes for DAFT PUNK, MOBY, FEDER, CAMELPHAT, MOGUAI to the first appearance on Tiefblau with “Drop it Like it’s Hot"", the duet sail between a Nu-Disco, Deep-House dance-floor oriented to a Melodic or Tropical House music, as a journey. 
Like this summer 2012 in Ibiza where Vijay & Sofia decided to create this duo.
As a couple, in life and behind the decks, Vijay & Sofia, they lead the discussion on social network and on the dance-floors since 8 years, but the career of Vijay started well before, with collaborations as the like of Camilo Franco, Nico Pusch or Rodriguez Jr. 
Without forgetting the past, Vijay open the doors to the duet at the end of 2012.
An artist can share his life only with another artist, and that's why the duo works so well. Sofia has the soul of an artist that sticks to the skin. 
A well-chosen word for a tattoo artist. This graphic artist with a strong universe is also a huge fan of music and dance (More than 12 years as dancer) and Vijay led him to be with him behind the decks and software productions.
The first success of Vijay & Sofia will come from some of these free Remixes and Edits available on Soundcloud for the followers. In two year, they will remixes artists like Asaf Avidan, Daft Punk, John Newman, Kiesza, Ben Howard, 2Pac, A$AP Rocky, Duke Dumont, Gabriel Rios, Buena Vista Social Club, Queen, Nicolas Jaar , and many
more.... Proof of their talent, the label of Daft Punk contacted Vijay & Sofia to release their remix of Get Lucky on Columbia in Vinyl Edition.
Except the several free download offer to their fans, the releases on major nu-disco & deep imprints are released on Armada Deep, Source/Spinnin, Tonspiel/Warner, Germany, Atlantic Records, The Bearded Man, Tanz Dich Glücklich, Tigers Records,
Delicious Recording, Sleazy Deep, Sleazy G, Street King, Spirit Soul Records, Future Allianz, Love Style, KiezBeats and others..., and reaching several time the best sales of Beatport.
Still an eye on the future, Vijay & Sofia Zlatko will release soon some new originals and and other surprises . And if the future of electronic music will be displayed with the belgian colors?:)

Ashley Mendes - helveticnerdz(a)gmail.com

One of the most dedicated, hard-working characters in the industry, Grammy-nominated DJ, producer and label head, EDX, has spent almost three decades at the forefront of electronic music. Founder of the internationally renowned record company Sirup Music in 2002, which has released hits from the likes of Avicii, Armin van Buuren, Steve Angello, Tiësto and more — and in joint-venture with Enormous Tunes his ‘Helvetic Nerds’ crew of Nora En Pure, Daniel Portman, Croatia Squad and Sons of Maria — Maurizio's own vast catalogue of chart-topping original productions and remixes has amassed hundreds of millions of streams and an adoring international fan-base in the process.
His ‘NoXcuses' radio show on iHeart (formerly on SiriusXM’s Electric Area) is currently broadcast to over 40 countries twice a week and with an international touring schedule that regularly sees him cross multiple countries and continents each week, Maurizio has held residencies at some of the world’s most iconic clubs (Space Ibiza, Privilege Ibiza and Wynn Las Vegas to name a few) and consistently performs at the most esteemed festivals on the global circuit.
With a forced hiatus in international touring casting a shadow over the majority of 2020 and a large part of 2021, EDX used the ‘down time’ as an opportunity to channel his boundless creativity and energy into other parts of his businesses, spending considerable time with his label and management teams in Zürich to navigate the turbulent times and ensure a smooth and quick transition out of lockdown when the moment came. With three US tours under his belt already in 2021 however – not to mention a handful of internationally celebrated, chart-topping hits – EDX is clearly bouncing back from the woes of the pandemic with renewed vigour and replenished energy. Replete with creative aspiration, and with much more music in the pipeline due to drop this year, the recent global blip isn’t going to dampen his spirits. Optimistic that life is now returning to some degree of normality, EDX is raring to get back to where he belongs, as he grabs another year by the horns and makes us dance for all it’s worth.",True,Zurich,CH,164294,21,61,738,https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000105498019-ohvx6d-large.jpg,None,66,None,2021-08-30T15:31:52Z,2011-01-17T12:19:48Z

✖✖✖ BIO ✖✖✖

Reaching more than one million of clicks per month just on Soundcloud, Vijay & Sofia Zlatko attain massive stats for an underground artist. It must say that the Belgium duet didn't steal this success! From their remixes for DAFT PUNK, MOBY, FEDER, CAMELPHAT, MOGUAI to the first appearance on Tiefblau with “Drop it Like it’s Hot"", the duet sail between a Nu-Disco, Deep-House dance-floor oriented to a Melodic or Tropical House music, as a journey. 
Like this summer 2012 in Ibiza where Vijay & Sofia decided to create this duo.
As a couple, in life and behind the decks, Vijay & Sofia, they lead the discussion on social network and on the dance-floors since 8 years, but the career of Vijay started well before, with collaborations as the like of Camilo Franco, Nico Pusch or Rodriguez Jr. 
Without forgetting the past, Vijay open the doors to the duet at the end of 2012.
An artist can share his life only with another artist, and that's why the duo works so well. Sofia has the soul of an artist that sticks to the skin. 
A well-chosen word for a tattoo artist. This graphic artist with a strong universe is also a huge fan of music and dance (More than 12 years as dancer) and Vijay led him to be with him behind the decks and software productions.
The first success of Vijay & Sofia will come from some of these free Remixes and Edits available on Soundcloud for the followers. In two year, they will remixes artists like Asaf Avidan, Daft Punk, John Newman, Kiesza, Ben Howard, 2Pac, A$AP Rocky, Duke Dumont, Gabriel Rios, Buena Vista Social Club, Queen, Nicolas Jaar , and many
more.... Proof of their talent, the label of Daft Punk contacted Vijay & Sofia to release their remix of Get Lucky on Columbia in Vinyl Edition.
Except the several free download offer to their fans, the releases on major nu-disco & deep imprints are released on Armada Deep, Source/Spinnin, Tonspiel/Warner, Germany, Atlantic Records, The Bearded Man, Tanz Dich Glücklich, Tigers Records,
Delicious Recording, Sleazy Deep, Sleazy G, Street King, Spirit Soul Records, Future Allianz, Love Style, KiezBeats and others..., and reaching several time the best sales of Beatport.
Still an eye on the future, Vijay & Sofia Zlatko will release soon some new originals and and other surprises . And if the future of electronic music will be displayed with the belgian colors?:)

Sam Feldt & Möwe feat. Karra - Down For Anything - OUT NOW
sptfy.com/Edy
 
This Austrian deep house & indie pop duo have rapidly risen the ranks, stealing music hearts across the globe. Racking up a colossal 100 Million+ streams across multiple platforms, boasting 4 million Spotify listeners across 61 countries, and enticing fans by showing off their phenomenal DJ and Live PA performances at 100,000 crowd strong events such as Pride Vienna, and iconic venues and locations such as Ushuaïa Ibiza, Amsterdam Dance Event, Nos Trilhos Sao Paulo, Pacha Germany and BadenFahrt Festival Switzerland to name a few. 

Möwe was founded by members Clemens Martinuzzi and Melanie Ebietoma in 2013. Now in their mid 20’s and both music aficionados from the start, the two met while they were playing in Indie Rockbands; “Mary lost her Pathos” and “At Pavillon”. They quickly realised that their music stylings matched incredibly well, and began creating music together! First inspired by a bitter cold winter day in Vienna and their longing for something to bring them warmth and a high spirited feeling, they decided to create their new sound, which was the birth of Möwe. The rest, as they say, is history…

The unique duo released their first official track together in 2014 on Stil Vor Talent – the label of Oliver Koletzki. They then began developing their own distinct sound and style, bringing tunes like Blauer Tag (2013, 6 Million Streams), Sonnenkind (2014, 12 Million Streams), Birds flying high (2015, 17 Million Streams), and Lovers Friends (2016, 17 Million Streams). Their debut album ""Back in the Summer"" was released in 2016, which welcomed huge fan and notable DJ support. They have also had tremendous success on many of their single tracks, one of the most notable being Skyline in 2017, which has pulled in 10 Million+ streams and radio play worldwide including on the US taste makers station Sirius XM. 

They have stellar taste in labels, and have worked in tandem with Universal Music, Atlantic Records, Ministry of Sound, Big Beat, Armada Music, Ultra Music, Spinnin’ records and the powerhouse that is Discowax Sony worldwide. Among other interesting facts, they are extremely proud of their singing prowess, the fact that they both play guitar and bass, and that they both play keys. This impressive show of musicianship is just one of the reasons their live shows are a unique wow factor for the fans and are not to be missed! Showing no signs of slowing down for 2018, Möwe are bringing a stack full of new music including a collaboration with Sam Feldt, while also continuing to entertain fans with their live PA performances across the glove and Möwe’s Flying High Radio Show expanding to new levels. This duo is clearly a force to be reckoned with, and without question, they are artists to watch!",True,Vienna,AT,129794,2,100,107,https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000319755738-d2guee-large.jpg,None,16,None,2021-07-06T17:00:16Z,2013-01-07T20:16:52Z

693,64433,Turbo Recordings,Turbo,Recordings,Turbo Recordings,"Turbo Recordings was founded by Tiga in Montreal back in 1998. In addition to launching his own career, the label has been integral in the success of acts like Chromeo, Gesaffelstein, Duke Dumont and most recently, ANNA & Charlotte de Witte. Core talent includes ZZT (Tiga's collaboration with Zombie Nation), Jori Hulkkonen, BETON, Clouds, Harvard Bass, Pilo, Shaded, Dimitri Veimar and a host of new young producers in genres ranging from pure techno, electro, and house to pop. The list of artists who have released music on the label is a veritable 'who's who' of top-level talent spanning a broad musical range, and this, along with a commitment to beautiful design, has earned the label respect in the industry and a cult following among fans. 

“We started out singing into plastic bags and shipping them to stores as quickly as possible. Later, we discovered that vinyl sounds way better when delivered by kayak. I learned so much the first few years…Now, as I look towards the future, I can envision music for poor people, sonic odors for the hearing impaired, even MP3s for women....Vroom, sucka!” says Tiga, the lyrical lampsman lighting the way down Dance Avenue.

694,12475833,Ahmet Kilic,Ahmet,Kılıç,Ahmet Kılıç,"BIO:
Ahmet was born in Kardjali, Bulgaria where he spent his childhood. His introduction into music came from his father's obsession with electronic equipment. At 10 years old Ahmet was so curious about how the electronic equipment worked that he began assembling and disassembling some parts of the electronic goods in his house. At the age of 12 Ahmet made his first steps in his music career by making his own remixes which showed his passion for music. In 1991 Ahmet's family decided to move to Turkey; that was the beginning of a whole new life for him. 
 
He was going to school in Izmir, one of the biggest cities in Turkey, and in the evenings Ahmet was working in some ordinary bars as a DJ. After graduating in 1995 Ahmet decided to continue his professional music career and started working as a resident DJ in one of the biggest clubs in Izmir called ""Club Marina"". Later Ahmet wanted to make a difference in his life and continued his music career in different cities in the world working as a DJ in successful parties and organizations. According to topdeejays.com in Turkey Ahmet became the #1 DJ in ""DEEP HOUSE"",  #1 DJ with the most followers in YouTube and multiple times #1 on Beatport Mixes

Among countless accolades, Aimée won the Montreux Jazz Festival Vocal Competition and the Sarah Vaughn International Jazz Vocal Competition. As an actress, Aimée co-starred with Bernadette Peters in a Stephen Sondheim tribute at New York’s City Center which inspired her to dig deeper into Sondheim's repertoire, resulting in her fourth and most recent album, Move On: A Sondheim Adventure.

A tribe is viewed as a social group, united by connection to an idea, a leader, and most importantly, each other. Tribal Trap is a dedicated company of producers, performers and vocalists from all over the world; a family; taking over the scene one release at a time. While only being active as a label for just four years, Tribal Trap has already been ranked as 5th biggest label of The Netherlands by magazines like DJ Mag and Rankingz.. and it's just the beginning.

“During this volatile period in the music scene where we’ve seen an explosion in the number of independent music labels, Tribal Trap seems to have risen above the rest by consistently putting out powerful and deadly tunes. Recognized as one of the main channels that pioneered the Trap genre, any producer would be delighted to have a notch on their belt from the outlet.” (source thewaxhole.com)

Some were Holland natives, and others had come to attend local colleges and universities. While the original Holland nucleus has now dispersed to various parts of the country, the fellowship is still growing, with new friends and shared projects with other independent labels. Asthmatic Kitty is now based in Lander, Wyoming, Indianapolis, Indiana and New York City.

Asthmatic Kitty was named after Sara, a voluptuous orange and white longhair who wandered out of the woods in 1995, pregnant, starving, and afflicted with various parasites and ailments, including feline asthma. Although she still wheezes a bit, especially when being chased by her sister Tabby, Sara today enjoys a healthy and happy life of luxury.

Within the last 4 years alone, he has received a considerable amount of support from some of the biggest names in the game, including collaborations and plays from the likes of Alan Walker, The Chainsmokers, Krewella, Slushii, K391, and more.

VINI VICI BIOGRAPHY 2016 

Vini Vici is the new project of Aviram Saharai & Matan Kadosh, both well-known and experienced electronic music producers for over a decade.
The concept of Vini Vici was formed by the boys with an intention to express their love for the old school sound, paired with their progressive ideas.
Iboga Records and FM Bookings, widely considered to be the biggest psytrance label and booking agency, were the first to see the potential of the project and invited them to be part of their well respected family, alongside names such as: Ace Ventura, Liquid Soul, Ticon, Captain Hook, Atmos, and the like.

After the huge success of their premier EP 'Divine Mode' and their follow-up ‘Back Underground’, ‘Expender’, ‘Anything & Everything’, and ‘Veni Vidi Vici’ tracks (all top sellers on Beatport and Iboga Records charts), Vini Vici continued to produce massive hits while touring the world nonstop - Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, Switzerland, Finland, France, India, Denmark, Germany, United State, Italy, Portugal, Austria, Australia, Serbia, Netherland, Scotland, United Kingdom, Ireland, Israel…..
It's no surprise Beatport positioned them at No.3 on the Top Artist list of 2014.
2015 was a huge step forward for the boys with the release of their debut album ‘Vini Vici - Future Classics’. They hit the Beatport Main Chart at No.2 (Psytrance at No.1) - a position that very few psytrance artists have managed to stand at before, followed by Psyshop No.1 and TrackItDown No.1 spots, while the legendary Infected Mushroom named them “the best upcoming psytrance artists at the moment”. The explosion continued when trance king Armin Van Buuren edited their already classic tune ‘The Tribe’, and featured them on his legendary ‘ASOT’ radio show over and over again.

Finishing 2015 with a bang, the boys were ranked by Beatport as No.1 on the PsyTrance Artist chart and they also landed the Best Selling Track of 2015. They continued to make history early in 2016 with their Vini Vici Remix of ‘Hilight Tribe - Free Tibet’ - the track gained over 15,000,000 views on YouTube and 5,000,000 plays on Soundcloud, while also hitting the No.2 spot on Beatport’s Main chart, and becoming the first psytrance track ever to have entered the Beatport Main Top 10.

After such an outstanding beginning to 2016, it’s no surprise that the rest of their year continued to bring this elevated level and even after many successful years before became their best year by far. Some even call it the ‘The Vini Vici Year’ - with over 220 shows in some of the most prestigious electronic music events around the globe (A State Of Trance Festival NL, Tomorrowland BE, Boom Festival PT, Electric Daisy Carnival in U.S.A, Ultra BR, Dreamstate U.S.A, Transmission CZ, Experience BR, Vuuv DE, Sunburn GOA, Luminosity NL, Earthcore AU, Unity IL just to name a few…).

Keeping their No.1 spot on Beatport’s Psytrance Artist list and Best Selling Track for the second year in a row went on to lead a new generation of psytrance fans and producers to their style. Just before ending off 2016 came the jewel in the crown; a collaboration with no other than one of the solid founders of modern electronic music - Armin Van Buuren, featuring french band Hilight Tribe in their creation ‘Great Spirit’. This massive collaboration took over the Beatport Main Chart immediately and gained over 1,000,000 views on YouTube in just 2 weeks, taking them one step closer to their life goal of spreading psytrance culture and energy in the world.

Armin van Buuren: “I’ve wanted to work with Vini Vici ever since they embarked on the music scene. Few acts have such a well-defined signature sound”

VINI VICI BIOGRAPHY 2016 

Vini Vici is the new project of Aviram Saharai & Matan Kadosh, both well-known and experienced electronic music producers for over a decade.
The concept of Vini Vici was formed by the boys with an intention to express their love for the old school sound, paired with their progressive ideas.
Iboga Records and FM Bookings, widely considered to be the biggest psytrance label and booking agency, were the first to see the potential of the project and invited them to be part of their well respected family, alongside names such as: Ace Ventura, Liquid Soul, Ticon, Captain Hook, Atmos, and the like.

After the huge success of their premier EP 'Divine Mode' and their follow-up ‘Back Underground’, ‘Expender’, ‘Anything & Everything’, and ‘Veni Vidi Vici’ tracks (all top sellers on Beatport and Iboga Records charts), Vini Vici continued to produce massive hits while touring the world nonstop - Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, Switzerland, Finland, France, India, Denmark, Germany, United State, Italy, Portugal, Austria, Australia, Serbia, Netherland, Scotland, United Kingdom, Ireland, Israel…..
It's no surprise Beatport positioned them at No.3 on the Top Artist list of 2014.
2015 was a huge step forward for the boys with the release of their debut album ‘Vini Vici - Future Classics’. They hit the Beatport Main Chart at No.2 (Psytrance at No.1) - a position that very few psytrance artists have managed to stand at before, followed by Psyshop No.1 and TrackItDown No.1 spots, while the legendary Infected Mushroom named them “the best upcoming psytrance artists at the moment”. The explosion continued when trance king Armin Van Buuren edited their already classic tune ‘The Tribe’, and featured them on his legendary ‘ASOT’ radio show over and over again.

Finishing 2015 with a bang, the boys were ranked by Beatport as No.1 on the PsyTrance Artist chart and they also landed the Best Selling Track of 2015. They continued to make history early in 2016 with their Vini Vici Remix of ‘Hilight Tribe - Free Tibet’ - the track gained over 15,000,000 views on YouTube and 5,000,000 plays on Soundcloud, while also hitting the No.2 spot on Beatport’s Main chart, and becoming the first psytrance track ever to have entered the Beatport Main Top 10.

After such an outstanding beginning to 2016, it’s no surprise that the rest of their year continued to bring this elevated level and even after many successful years before became their best year by far. Some even call it the ‘The Vini Vici Year’ - with over 220 shows in some of the most prestigious electronic music events around the globe (A State Of Trance Festival NL, Tomorrowland BE, Boom Festival PT, Electric Daisy Carnival in U.S.A, Ultra BR, Dreamstate U.S.A, Transmission CZ, Experience BR, Vuuv DE, Sunburn GOA, Luminosity NL, Earthcore AU, Unity IL just to name a few…).

Keeping their No.1 spot on Beatport’s Psytrance Artist list and Best Selling Track for the second year in a row went on to lead a new generation of psytrance fans and producers to their style. Just before ending off 2016 came the jewel in the crown; a collaboration with no other than one of the solid founders of modern electronic music - Armin Van Buuren, featuring french band Hilight Tribe in their creation ‘Great Spirit’. This massive collaboration took over the Beatport Main Chart immediately and gained over 1,000,000 views on YouTube in just 2 weeks, taking them one step closer to their life goal of spreading psytrance culture and energy in the world.

Armin van Buuren: “I’ve wanted to work with Vini Vici ever since they embarked on the music scene. Few acts have such a well-defined signature sound”

Above & Beyond and long-time collaborator Justine Suissa share their first joint effort in over four years, ‘Almost Home’. 

‘Almost Home’ is Above & Beyond’s first club track of 2021, arriving just in time for their Group Therapy 450 milestone show at The Drumsheds in London this September. ABGT450 is their first headline show in over a year, and will see the trio perform to an audience of more than 10,000 fans. Later in September, Above & Beyond embark on the Anjunafamily Reunion Tour, which visits major cities across the U.S.A. including sold-out stops at Red Rocks Amphitheatre, Stanford’s Frost Amphitheater and the world-famous Echostage in D.C. 

Jono, Tony, Paavo and Justine have been working together since 2000 when they formed the group OceanLab. In 2008, they released their first and only album ‘Sirens Of The Sea’,a record that has gained near-mythical status among trance fans. More recently, Above & Beyond and Justine have collaborated on club hits like ‘Alright Now’, ‘Cold Feet’ and ‘Another Chance’, and emotive, downtempo records like ‘Little Something’. 

In 2016, Justine joined Above & Beyond during their sell-out ‘Acoustic II’ tour, which stopped at iconic venues including Royal Albert Hall in London and The Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles. 

“This is a track that we originally wrote with Justine some years ago. Like many musicians during lockdown, we buried ourselves in the studio and had plenty of time to pick through old ideas. ‘Almost Home’, with its ’80s production influences, caught our ear. We sent it across to Justine again, and she rewrote the second verse to reflect her feelings on it today - we won’t tell you what it’s about though, we’ll leave that for you to decide. This track started in quite a different form, so we’ve also done a Club Mix to bring it a bit more up-to-date. It’s quite emotional to think that we’ll be able to play this one live for you all very soon. Take care for now!” - Above & Beyond

About Armin van Buuren:
It takes little to recognize that Armin van Buuren is one of the world’s biggest DJs and producers in electronic music for over twenty years. His life-long dedication to the scene has earned him a Grammy® nomination for ‘This Is What It Feels Like’ (feat. Trevor Guthrie) and saw him release global hit singles such as ‘Blah Blah Blah’, ‘Wild Wild Son’, ‘Therapy’, ‘Sex, Love & Water’, ‘Sunny Days’, ‘I Need You’ and ‘Another You’. Additionally, he claimed the number one spot in the annual DJ Mag Top 100 DJs poll for an unprecedented five times, contributing to the nineteen consecutive top 5 spots to date (the most recent being a #4 in the DJ Mag Top 100 DJs poll of 2020).

VINI VICI BIOGRAPHY 2016 

Vini Vici is the new project of Aviram Saharai & Matan Kadosh, both well-known and experienced electronic music producers for over a decade.
The concept of Vini Vici was formed by the boys with an intention to express their love for the old school sound, paired with their progressive ideas.
Iboga Records and FM Bookings, widely considered to be the biggest psytrance label and booking agency, were the first to see the potential of the project and invited them to be part of their well respected family, alongside names such as: Ace Ventura, Liquid Soul, Ticon, Captain Hook, Atmos, and the like.

After the huge success of their premier EP 'Divine Mode' and their follow-up ‘Back Underground’, ‘Expender’, ‘Anything & Everything’, and ‘Veni Vidi Vici’ tracks (all top sellers on Beatport and Iboga Records charts), Vini Vici continued to produce massive hits while touring the world nonstop - Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, Switzerland, Finland, France, India, Denmark, Germany, United State, Italy, Portugal, Austria, Australia, Serbia, Netherland, Scotland, United Kingdom, Ireland, Israel…..
It's no surprise Beatport positioned them at No.3 on the Top Artist list of 2014.
2015 was a huge step forward for the boys with the release of their debut album ‘Vini Vici - Future Classics’. They hit the Beatport Main Chart at No.2 (Psytrance at No.1) - a position that very few psytrance artists have managed to stand at before, followed by Psyshop No.1 and TrackItDown No.1 spots, while the legendary Infected Mushroom named them “the best upcoming psytrance artists at the moment”. The explosion continued when trance king Armin Van Buuren edited their already classic tune ‘The Tribe’, and featured them on his legendary ‘ASOT’ radio show over and over again.

Finishing 2015 with a bang, the boys were ranked by Beatport as No.1 on the PsyTrance Artist chart and they also landed the Best Selling Track of 2015. They continued to make history early in 2016 with their Vini Vici Remix of ‘Hilight Tribe - Free Tibet’ - the track gained over 15,000,000 views on YouTube and 5,000,000 plays on Soundcloud, while also hitting the No.2 spot on Beatport’s Main chart, and becoming the first psytrance track ever to have entered the Beatport Main Top 10.

After such an outstanding beginning to 2016, it’s no surprise that the rest of their year continued to bring this elevated level and even after many successful years before became their best year by far. Some even call it the ‘The Vini Vici Year’ - with over 220 shows in some of the most prestigious electronic music events around the globe (A State Of Trance Festival NL, Tomorrowland BE, Boom Festival PT, Electric Daisy Carnival in U.S.A, Ultra BR, Dreamstate U.S.A, Transmission CZ, Experience BR, Vuuv DE, Sunburn GOA, Luminosity NL, Earthcore AU, Unity IL just to name a few…).

Keeping their No.1 spot on Beatport’s Psytrance Artist list and Best Selling Track for the second year in a row went on to lead a new generation of psytrance fans and producers to their style. Just before ending off 2016 came the jewel in the crown; a collaboration with no other than one of the solid founders of modern electronic music - Armin Van Buuren, featuring french band Hilight Tribe in their creation ‘Great Spirit’. This massive collaboration took over the Beatport Main Chart immediately and gained over 1,000,000 views on YouTube in just 2 weeks, taking them one step closer to their life goal of spreading psytrance culture and energy in the world.

Armin van Buuren: “I’ve wanted to work with Vini Vici ever since they embarked on the music scene. Few acts have such a well-defined signature sound”

1050,179225630,SHOUSE,None,None,None,"SHOUSE is Ed & Jack; a couple of friends who like to hang out to make weirdo-house and the occasional anthem. Their live-house sets these days incorporate a network of analog synthesisers, sequencers and drum machines, along with bizarre instruments tinkered up in Jack's dad's rural shed intersperse. House jam interspersed with huge, choral, anthemic moments. Always a chance to dance, bringing the people together as one within a liminal space. Always a strange, ecstatic, transcendental time.

Their recent song Love Tonight has morphed into a global pandemic release phenomenon. Love Tonight has become so many things for so many people. A declaration of love during a time of isolation. A demonstration of solidarity. A cry of collective strength.

Jack and Ed have spent much of 2020 locked down in Melbourne and are ready to reach out across the world in the spirit of Love Tonight. That is all we need.

-------My Story:------
Hi, out there, iam Andre´ from Augsburg, Germany. Iam 28 years old, and started dj´ing on 4/20 ;) this year. 2012 i began to play harmonica and piano, it is a lot of fun, but personally i needed another challenge. In march we had a party and listened to minimal hardtech, and i felt in love at the  1st minute. The sound was hypnotizing as f*** and i thought to myself, ""it cant be that hard to make something like this"". Vol 1 was my first try. It turned out, it´s not that bad, so i tried and tried. So i think it was worth the time trying. I guess anybody can do incredible thinks, so just try anything you like, and stick to your hobby ;), and never give up. Thats my back-story. I hope you like the music i make. Love ya´ll ""Pigeon Andrew""

Widely acknowledged as one of the most prominent flag-bearers for Techno globally and a regular fixture inside the world’s most distinguished DJ booths, Deborah has the unique ability to transfix crowds with her electrically charged, technically nuanced sets, fusing hard techno with minimal grooves and melodic soundscapes to absorbing effect. A pioneer in the use of social networks as a promotional tool, whilst somehow managing to retain a strong sense of discretion in her private life, Deborah is unrivalled in her determination and passion, earning every part of her current status as one of the most exciting talents to emerge from the international Techno scene over the past decade.
Born under the shade of the infamous Vele di Scampia – one of the toughest districts in Naples – the now-globally recognised DJ, producer and label head came from humble beginnings, forging her path to international success against unlikely odds. However this was to become her making. “You shouldn’t let anybody tell you what you can or can’t become”, she expounded in a rare interview, referencing her early livelihood as a nightclub dancer. “It’s true, in recent years I have gained popularity, but I am very grateful for the long journey it’s taken”. More than anything else, Deborah’s roots and her unwavering ethic are an integral part of the flourishing artist we see before us today.
Deborah spent the formative years of her musical career in Northern Italy, following a brief stint at fashion school in Modena. Cutting her teeth on the European club circuit, where she quickly realised music was her true calling, Deborah’s hard work and relentless determination eventually began to pay off and in 2013 she launched her very own imprint Sola_mente Records. Created as a platform by which to release her own music, free from creative pressure and external constraints, the label went from strength to strength and in November 2018, Deborah marked a decade-long career in the industry with the critically acclaimed release of her debut album ‘Ten’.

Mika Kitten is a DJ/Producer from Kobe, Japan. She began her DJ career in 2010 spinning trance and techno in underground Japanese clubs. Her current style of melodious, groovy techno has earned her performances around the world including L.A., New York, Sweden, France, Switzerland, Dubai, Malaysia, Cambodia, and Korea. Not content to simply rock dancefloors, Mika began producing in 2015. Underground record labels from Italy, Spain, Russia, Germany, Dubai and the U.S. were quick to sign her tracks. Her release on California’s Digital records has been streamed over a million times on SoundCloud and her EP with Reload Records reached 62 on Beatport’s Techno Top 100 chart. She soon reached 44 on the same chart with a release on Berlin’s YOMO Records.

We believe that a pure and bright music with its positive vibes has the power to reconnect man to nature and in this idea we find the essence of our art. 

Our journey began as a multifaceted one man band and led us to who we are today: a duo creating atmospheric music. Our music is melodic and dreamy and we like to define it as ""blue music"" for its tones, metaphors and lyrics' contents. Blue is indeed the color of serenity, calmness and it's always been connected to the spirituality wherever in the world, when humanity looked for something more significant and deeper. In the Blue Lotus we traditionally find and see this light and this research of inner peace which associates our path to Buddhism and to the other Oriental philosophies, in our case through the positive use of sounds.",None,Naples,IT,328,33,30,26,https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000227173124-2h1aef-large.jpg,None,3,None,2018-10-21T17:49:53Z,2010-10-31T17:45:58Z

1118,508812546,Miμ,None,None,None,"Just letting y'all know, I'll only post things that I can't find on Soundcloud, given the fact that I've either received permission or it doesn't break any rules. If there are none stated then I'll just do my thing, if you see any tracks that I've posted that are yours and you don't feel comfortable with it being there then do please message a complaint and I'll take it down the next time I log into Soundcloud. Also, just for clarification, I'm not making money off of anyone's songs that aren't mine, not that I'll ever make any music that actually enjoyable.

Lobotomy Corporation is hell on a bicycle, I for some reason accidentally got two plague doctors on day 40-something and when one turned into the Jesus Fetus, I had to suppress two of them. Fun
I am absolutely in love with the Touhou series, I generally like the idea of Danmaku at its core. The most beautiful pattern wins, because the more beautiful the pattern, the more bullets you have to dodge. You must deliberately put in openings here and there to keep things fair and balanced. This is a rule to even the playing ground for both those that are weak and those that are strong, it's a system that also rewards you on skill. So just as long as you have a form of a projectile that you can fire, so long as you're able to dodge successfully and consecutively, you'll probably come out on top. Makes you wonder if Reimu's either a person that just acts on impulse or if she's just a really big brain person. I'm willing to bet on the former

1130,67457675,Hatchie,Harriette,Pilbeam,Harriette Pilbeam,"A Hatchie song is immediately transportive -- a celestial collision of shoegaze and pop, a haze of reverb-laden guitar lines and lyrics acutely charting a vivid flood of emotions, about anything from falling in love to anxieties about your own identity. It’s a map of Harriette Pilbeam’s interior world, wrapped up in gauzy, wall-of-sound daydreams. The Brisbane, Aus. native behind the moniker makes music that’s hook-laden and thoughtful, dreamy and dense, and, above all, immediately recognizable as Hatchie. 

“This Enchanted” is Hatchie’s first new single since her lauded debut album Keepsake, as well as the first release via Secretly Canadian. It captures the intense rush of love, the way you can plunge into those feelings the same way you could drown in a Hatchie song -- a tidal wave of swirling textures, kaleidoscopic guitars and layers of twinkling synths, but with intensified energy. Consider it, if you will, a reintroduction to Hatchie’s sound.

Punctuated by an oversized bassline, “This Enchanted” is a dusky, nebulous glimmer, envisioning Hatchie on the dance floor, essentially capturing a creative spark on tape. For Pilbeam, it felt like a lightbulb moment in her songwriting, a burst of creative energy and sudden inspiration for the new places she’d take Hatchie from the initial waves of success. A new direction inviting more movement, more fun -- diverting away from shoegaze and inviting the listener to look up, too.

Since the early 2000’s the name DJ Fresh has been synonymous with innovation, but after 20 years of success in the music industry including signing acts like Pendulum and Chase and Status to his label Breakbeat Kaos, Fresh took a step back from touring and playing global shows to concentrate on his health, following a thyroid cancer diagnosis in 2016. He attended a Ruby boot-camp and became a Machine Learning Developer at a leading education research company in Oxford, where his work helped to win innovation awards.

An acclaimed DJ and producer, DJ Fresh is widely recognised as one of the UK’s most influential electronic music artists.

One of the early ambassadors of drum and bass in North America, STRANJAH has cemented his position in the bass music world with seminal releases on Metalheadz, 31 Records and Renegade Hardware.  His sound initially caught the attention of L Double at Flex Records in 1999 which led to a string of releases.  In the early 2000’s he worked with frequent collaborator Gremlinz, and the pair would find their music in the hands of legends Goldie and Doc Scott, which eventually would land releases on Metalheadz and 31 Records.

Recently STRANJAH has done work for massive labels such as Critical Music and Hospital Records.  Drawing from a number of influences, his sound is incredibly eclectic and essentially impossible to label under one umbrella.  His modern-day sound is best characterized by expressive bass design, 90's chord stabs and syncopated drum breaks.  STRANJAH has seen success with his new YouTube channel demystifying music production for a new generation of producers.  With his label Deviant Audio, he has made it his mission to help others succeed by providing knowledge, tools and resources to excel ones own production.",None,Toronto,CA,10613,339,1034,127,https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-vW2XRN4TZJgYtSNy-b26VGQ-large.jpg,None,24,None,2021-02-03T02:49:03Z,2008-10-31T02:33:36Z

1237,139122,Hansollo,Daniel,Noetzel,Daniel Noetzel," Hansollo, also known as Daniel Noetzel, is a d'n'b and dubstep producer. His fascination with music has guided him through numerous musical genres. At the turn of 2004/2005 he discovered drum and bass and at this time he made his first steps in production. His passion was not only about music. He was very much into graffiti before, but the music set bombing aside. In 2007 he discovers dubstep and becomes deeply interested in its evolution. Also the same year he starts dj'ing. The real breakthrough was 2009 though. His tunes gain international acclaim, being played and remixed worldwide. In production he turns from dnb to dubstep and experimental electronic, and in performing - from djing to playing live acts. His style is very unique, with lots of vocal samples, massive basslines and twisted melodies.

1275,1681027,Metal Blade Records,Metal ,Blade,Metal  Blade,"Metal Blade Records history by Dan Slessor:
Founded upon owner Brian Slagel's enduring drive to find great bands and get their music out to as many people as possible, since 1982 Metal Blade has brought wave after wave of powerful, innovative, and often genre-defining music to the ever-hungry metal masses. It is this ethos that has seen Metal Blade build up a stunning and diverse catalogue, weather the various storms facing any independent label, and in an age of declining record sales boast the most successful years of its existence as it strides into its fourth decade.

What perhaps makes this achievement all the more notable is the fact that Slagel never even intended to start a label. Working in an LA record store and writing for various publications, Slagel was acutely aware that many great bands in the local metal scene were being ignored, and he decided to release a compilation of tracks drawn from these ranks. ""There were a lot of really good bands and I was just bummed out that nobody could hear them. It just seemed like I could help them out and have some fun at the same time, and that compilation was the first Metal Massacre,"" he states. Collating tracks from then unknown bands including Ratt, Bitch, Cirith Ungol, and Metallica amongst others, the compilation sold out immediately. ""How important is Metal Blade to our career? They're only the reason we are enjoying the worldwide success we have today,"" states Metallica's James Hetfield. ""Without Brian's openness to some raunchy teens with a crap sounding cassette tape we would be who knows where, and playing who knows what!"" With the popularity of the tape spurring Slagel on, the first seeds of Metal Blade were sown. ""After the success of those compilations I just started putting out records of bands that I was friends with, but without ever really intending it to be a label at all,"" he explains. ""After I put out four or five releases I started to feel like something was happening, and I decided to quit the record store and quit college and see where it went.""

Battling through the first few lean years, when the label consisted solely of Slagel working out of his mom's poorly ventilated garage in the San Fernando Valley, it gradually grew in both revenue and stature. Within a few years Metal Blade would go on to release the debuts of Slayer, Armored Saint, Trouble, and Corrosion Of Conformity amongst others, fanning the flames of the burgeoning metal scene and launching careers of bands that would go onto reap global success. ""Without Metal Blade, there is a damn good chance we never would've made it out of L.A,"" says Slayer's Kerry King. ""That was the one bit of luck we needed. You can be the most awesome band on the scene, and if no one notices you, you don't catch on. And Brian Slagel is still one of the biggest metalheads I know!"" This genuine love and devotion to metal is central to the relationship many of the artists have with Metal Blade, and King Diamond credits much of its relevance and strength to this passion. ""I refer to it as having 'boots on the ground',"" the mighty Dane states. ""It's not like a major label where some people might be into what you're doing but a lot of them just see it as a job – there's a genuine love for metal there. Through staying true to that and doing their own thing they've carved out a very specific niche that they control, and as an artist it's wonderful to be a part of that.""over the years.

1316,191231654,Ozuna,None,None,None,"Jan Carlos Ozuna Rosado, nacido y criado en Puerto Rico el día 13 de marzo de 1992, en la cual asistió a la Academia el Sagrado Corazón, donde culminó sus estudios a nivel superior.

Ozuna, tal y como se apoda artísticamente, es intérprete y cantautor del género urbano, influenciado principalmente por su familia de músicos y bailarines en la que creció, y quienes le inculcaron la música como forma de vida y sustento. 

Sus inicios como compositor se dan a sus 12 años, cuando Ozuna comienza a escribir canciones para otras personas, amistades y cantantes que conocían el talento que tiene este joven para hacer de sus letras un éxito musical. Fue en ese preciso momento en el que Jan Ozuna se da cuenta de que no solo podía ser bueno 
para componer, sino también para cantar y convertirse en un gran intérprete.

 El género musical elegido por este talentoso chico fue el urbano, en el cual intenta marcar una gran diferencia, y es ahí donde se reconoce el talento de un joven que no quiere ser igual a los demás, quiere cambiar un paradigma que poco a poco ha venido construyendo su éxito en Puerto Rico, y es que Ozuna compone y canta canciones inspiradas en la belleza de la mujer, y su absoluta admiración por aquellas que en especial son luchadoras e independientes, todo esto sin caer en lo vulgar.. Su inspiración para marcar esta diferencia ha sido su pequeña hija de 1 año de edad, a quien le canta con respeto, entendiendo que cada letra que escribe es un legado, y espera que en un futura su hija jamás se sienta ofendida por alguna de sus canciones.

Durante siete años este chico trabajó incansablemente para como él mismo dice “ser alguien en la música”. Algunos éxitos y otras derrotas le enseñaron que el camino es largo, pero que su talento es valioso. Actualmente en este año 2015, Ozuna es un chico que ha logrado coronarse por más de 13 semanas consecutivas en los primeros lugares de las listas de canciones más escuchadas en Puerto Rico, todo esto gracias a su nueva producción musical que lleva por nombre “Odisea”, la cual se estrenará en su totalidad en Marzo del 2016,”bajo el sello independiente puertorriqueño VP Records, disquera perteneciente a su nuevo equipo de manejo VP Entertainment. De este disco nació el tema “Si no te quiere”, producido por Super Yei y Yancci,  el cual actualmente se escucha en países de América Latina, y se encuentra colocando con gran rapidez   en el mercado latino de los Estados Unidos, en ciudades importantes como Miami, Orlando, Philadelphia, Nueva York, buscando también encabezar las listas de las canciones más sonadas de la país.

“Si no te quiere”,  es un tema que ha logrado catapultar el talento de este cantante lleno de sueños, que poco a poco está haciendo realidad. Artistas internacionales del género urbano de la talla de Arcángel y Farruko ya reconocen el talento de este artista y participaron en la nueva version (remix)  del tema que ya esta programado en todas las emisoras de radio. 

Ozuna, afirma que su meta es siempre mantener su humildad, cualidad que siempre lo ha  caracterizado. Que su más grande ídolo es Dios, y su anhelo más grande es seguir evolucionando como cantautor para poder llevar su música con orgullo a territorios que nunca antes imaginó.",True,San Juan,PR,376475,None,None,104,https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-f8D8Ww4MiLD2sCky-4gu9Qg-large.jpg,None,6,None,2021-01-22T23:47:41Z,2015-12-05T18:22:44Z

1344,191231654,Ozuna,None,None,None,"Jan Carlos Ozuna Rosado, nacido y criado en Puerto Rico el día 13 de marzo de 1992, en la cual asistió a la Academia el Sagrado Corazón, donde culminó sus estudios a nivel superior.

Ozuna, tal y como se apoda artísticamente, es intérprete y cantautor del género urbano, influenciado principalmente por su familia de músicos y bailarines en la que creció, y quienes le inculcaron la música como forma de vida y sustento. 

Sus inicios como compositor se dan a sus 12 años, cuando Ozuna comienza a escribir canciones para otras personas, amistades y cantantes que conocían el talento que tiene este joven para hacer de sus letras un éxito musical. Fue en ese preciso momento en el que Jan Ozuna se da cuenta de que no solo podía ser bueno 
para componer, sino también para cantar y convertirse en un gran intérprete.

 El género musical elegido por este talentoso chico fue el urbano, en el cual intenta marcar una gran diferencia, y es ahí donde se reconoce el talento de un joven que no quiere ser igual a los demás, quiere cambiar un paradigma que poco a poco ha venido construyendo su éxito en Puerto Rico, y es que Ozuna compone y canta canciones inspiradas en la belleza de la mujer, y su absoluta admiración por aquellas que en especial son luchadoras e independientes, todo esto sin caer en lo vulgar.. Su inspiración para marcar esta diferencia ha sido su pequeña hija de 1 año de edad, a quien le canta con respeto, entendiendo que cada letra que escribe es un legado, y espera que en un futura su hija jamás se sienta ofendida por alguna de sus canciones.

Durante siete años este chico trabajó incansablemente para como él mismo dice “ser alguien en la música”. Algunos éxitos y otras derrotas le enseñaron que el camino es largo, pero que su talento es valioso. Actualmente en este año 2015, Ozuna es un chico que ha logrado coronarse por más de 13 semanas consecutivas en los primeros lugares de las listas de canciones más escuchadas en Puerto Rico, todo esto gracias a su nueva producción musical que lleva por nombre “Odisea”, la cual se estrenará en su totalidad en Marzo del 2016,”bajo el sello independiente puertorriqueño VP Records, disquera perteneciente a su nuevo equipo de manejo VP Entertainment. De este disco nació el tema “Si no te quiere”, producido por Super Yei y Yancci,  el cual actualmente se escucha en países de América Latina, y se encuentra colocando con gran rapidez   en el mercado latino de los Estados Unidos, en ciudades importantes como Miami, Orlando, Philadelphia, Nueva York, buscando también encabezar las listas de las canciones más sonadas de la país.

“Si no te quiere”,  es un tema que ha logrado catapultar el talento de este cantante lleno de sueños, que poco a poco está haciendo realidad. Artistas internacionales del género urbano de la talla de Arcángel y Farruko ya reconocen el talento de este artista y participaron en la nueva version (remix)  del tema que ya esta programado en todas las emisoras de radio. 

Ozuna, afirma que su meta es siempre mantener su humildad, cualidad que siempre lo ha  caracterizado. Que su más grande ídolo es Dios, y su anhelo más grande es seguir evolucionando como cantautor para poder llevar su música con orgullo a territorios que nunca antes imaginó.",True,San Juan,PR,376475,None,None,104,https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-f8D8Ww4MiLD2sCky-4gu9Qg-large.jpg,None,6,None,2021-01-22T23:47:41Z,2015-12-05T18:22:44Z

1352,2128143,Stick Figure,None,None,None,"With a calming air of production prowess, Stick Figure is back with his newest album, World on Fire, released on August 30th, 2019. As with his previous releases, World on Fire was written, produced and recorded by Woodruff, a self-taught musician, this time at Stick Figure-owned Great Stone Studios in Oakland, CA, former home of Green Day. World on Fire is Stick Figure’s seventh album, and debuted as Billboard's #1 Independent Album (w/ SEA & TEA), #1 Reggae album, #4 Digital Album, #5 New Albums, #5 Daily Building Album, #6 Top Albums, #6 Current Albums, #8 Top Albums (w/ TEA) and #34 Top 200. The album went on to be the #1 selling reggae album of 2019 (Billboard) and has to date sold over 100,000 copies (w/ TEA & SEA, Nielsen). An intuitive and accomplished producer, Woodruff crafts authentic artistry from the foundation of roots-dub reggae, featuring cavernous grooves, sparkling electronic orchestration, and thick rhythms. His songs and sounds have evolved throughout time while staying true to his signature sound. World on Fire is undoubtedly Stick Figure’s best production to date, and the attention to detail throughout the album’s almost seventy minutes creates a top-notch sonic experience. Inside the historic studio, Stick Figure band member Johnny Cosmic, an accomplished producer in his own right, teams up with Woodruff to mix and master each track. When completed, a brotherhood of hard-jamming musicians delivers this widescreen soundtrack in concert performances of consciousness-altering emancipation. Preceding World on Fire, Stick Figure has released six albums, all recorded solo, with Woodruff laying down the tracks one by one. The current live band line-up features Kevin Bong (KBong) on keyboards, Kevin Offitzer on drums, bassist Tommy Suliman and Johnny Cosmic on guitar, keyboards, and backing vocals, with Scott upfront on guitar and vocals. Stick Figure concerts are gatherings distinguished by audience sing-alongs, hard hitting bass, extended improvisational interludes, the mind-manifesting hues of a light show, and the much-anticipated entrance of the band’s canine mascot, a rescued Australian Shepherd, Cocoa The Tour Dog, who has her own 501(c)3 charity and her own beer collaboration, the aptly named Cocoanut IPA. The show becomes a family gathering that spans across age and demographic, coming together for good vibes and musicAt a time that reggae is reaching new heights of popularity, the release of World on Fire signifies a coronation of sorts.

After a dramatic runner-up finish on an early season of America's Got Talent, he worked with indie reggae label Easy Star Records, sharing stages with the likes of UB40, Mike Love, and Trevor Hall.

All along he followed his bliss, going his own independent way, bouncing back from setbacks. He built an enviable career on the road and in the studio, dividing his time between touring and spending time with Cassy and their two kids on his Texas farm.

Today, music is more a family affair than ever for Cas, who collaborates with Cassy on songwriting and now hits the road with his son Eben on bass and his daughter Nolah on fiddle.

What he says about ""All the Right People"" applies to his whole approach to music and life.

That magnetic flow that happens when you recognize and honor all the relationships that have helped shape the person you are, and being able to cultivate presence in your life wherever you're at and to find that internal sanctuary, whatever tragedy you might be going through.”

American Songwriter calls the song an ""instantly memorable singalong,"" but Cas goes deeper: ""It's a feeling, inspired by that energizing emotion that happens when things are in balance and you know you're exactly where you're supposed to be. That magnetic flow that happens when you recognize and honor all the relationships that have helped shape the person you are, and being able to cultivate presence in your life wherever you're at and to find that internal sanctuary, whatever tragedy you might be going through.”

""Blessings always come rearranged,"" he sings in ""Every Road I'm On.""

1363,19018612,Benny Benassi,Benny,Benassi,Benny Benassi,"Hailing from provincial Italy, world class DJ & producer Benny Benassi is a name needing little introduction but always deserving of wide admiration and acclaim.  Indulging in a career spanning fifteen plus years, Benassi is renown as a humble, authentic and charming character who has grown from club DJ to festival king to multi-million selling record producer taking success in his stride. Trademarking his unique infusion of house and electro with his global smash “Satisfaction” Benny has continued to create music which is a clear evolution of this signature sound but never deviating too far. 

There is no better place to start delving into the rich history of the Benassi career than with his international blockbuster, “Satisfaction” and its game-changing music video became his launch pad into stardom. Created with his cousin and producer, Alle Benassi, and inspired by the car horns outside an open street facing window, this single catapulted into the charts with a #1 in France, #2 in the UK and Germany. Followed by his debut album Hypnotica, which reached top 20 across nearly all parts of Europe within the first month of release. 

The next few years for Benny were a culmination of successes, whether it be the major festivals he went on the play (Coachella, EDC, Ultra Music Festival, Tomorrowland to name a few) or his next artist album, Rock N Rave in 2008. The same year he won a Grammy Award for his ground breaking remix of Public Enemy “Bring The Noise” further catapulting the Benassi name into stardom. 

In 2011, Benny teamed up with a star-studded album cast for his album Electroman which featured T-Pain, Kelis, Jean-Baptsiste and Apl.de.ap amongst others and most famously Gary Go with his chart-topping single “Cinema”.  The Skrillex remix of “Cinema” not only went Gold in the US and platinum in Australia and Canada but won the Benassi’s another Grammy whilst holding firm in the iTunes top 10 dance chart for over 6 months. 

Still on this exceptional career high, Benny Benassi combined talents with Chris Brown to create one of the biggest cross-over dance records of its time with “Beautiful People”. The following years have been a measure of incredible world tours and releases, most notably his record “Dance The Pain Away” with John Legend, which premiered live on stage at Coachella with John himself. 

2016 saw Benny released his first album in five years Danceaholic, an unexpected, stunning cocktail of already released tracks, two unreleased reworks of older singles and brand new songs, led by the hit summer anthem “Paradise”, once again with Chris Brown. “Paradise” stayed in the Top 50 UK charts for 10 weeks and boasts more than 65 million video views and close to 47 million Spotify streams. 

In recent years, Benny's main releases include “Everybody Needs A Kiss” featured US duo Sofi Tukker racking up over 10 millions streams online and was featured as the sound of gay pride for Musica.ly, ""Lonely Nights"" featuring Lil Yachty, interspersed with two great house-oriented tracks, ""Inside"" with Chris Nasty, performing well in clubs and on streaming platforms and ""Everybody Hates Monday Mornings"" with his own production outfit, BB Team, and featuring the eccentric and charismatic YouTuber, Canguro English.

Beyond his own productions he brought his sound to a wider musical audience with a flurry of high-profile remixes with the likes of Bob Marley & The Wailers, Giorgio Moroder, Madonna, Sean Paul and the Rolling Stones, to name but a few; whilst maintaining a weekly radio show on the US heavy-weight iHeart Radio broadcasting to a staggering quarter of a billion listeners monthly.",True,Reggio Emilia,IT,639083,None,None,487,https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000465605466-58xxfr-large.jpg,None,91,None,2021-09-12T15:39:00Z,2012-06-20T20:07:44Z

As with his previous releases, World on Fire was written, produced and recorded by Woodruff, a self-taught musician, this time at Stick Figure-owned Great Stone Studios in Oakland, CA, former home of Green Day. World on Fire is Stick Figure’s seventh album, and debuted as Billboard's #1 Independent Album (w/ SEA & TEA), #1 Reggae album, #4 Digital Album, #5 New Albums, #5 Daily Building Album, #6 Top Albums, #6 Current Albums, #8 Top Albums (w/ TEA) and #34 Top 200. The album went on to be the #1 selling reggae album of 2019 (Billboard) and has to date sold over 100,000 copies (w/ TEA & SEA, Nielsen). An intuitive and accomplished producer, Woodruff crafts authentic artistry from the foundation of roots-dub reggae, featuring cavernous grooves, sparkling electronic orchestration, and thick rhythms. His songs and sounds have evolved throughout time while staying true to his signature sound. World on Fire is undoubtedly Stick Figure’s best production to date, and the attention to detail throughout the album’s almost seventy minutes creates a top-notch sonic experience. Inside the historic studio, Stick Figure band member Johnny Cosmic, an accomplished producer in his own right, teams up with Woodruff to mix and master each track. When completed, a brotherhood of hard-jamming musicians delivers this widescreen soundtrack in concert performances of consciousness-altering emancipation.

The show becomes a family gathering that spans across age and demographic, coming together for good vibes and musicAt a time that reggae is reaching new heights of popularity, the release of World on Fire signifies a coronation of sorts.

Además de cautivar con su voz a los amantes del reggae pero también al público en general y de contar con composiciones dulces, armónicas, emotivas y prolijas, ocurre con este artista algo digno de destacar. Manteniéndose fiel a su línea de artista independiente, desde que inició su camino como solista han pasado ya 7 años y 6 discos (Jah Guia, Hermanos, Amor-es, Vivi en do, Tranquilo y Transparente); durante todo este tiempo Dread Mar I no ha parado de crecer y cosechar seguidores a su paso, además de confirmar la reelevancia de su música llevando a realizar presentaciones con locales sold out en toda la Argentina, y girar por Brasil, México, Venezuela, Costa Rica, Perú, Uruguay, Jamaica, Ecuador, Guatemala, y varios países más.
El mérito de haber recorrido este camino solo, dicen, es una de las más grandes recompensas y uno de los mejores modos que tiene un artista para hablar de sí mismo, crecer y lograr valoración y reconocimiento gracias al ""boca en boca"" es una característica excepcional que, sumada a los atributos artísticos, hacen que hoy por hoy Dread Mar I sea uno de los músicos más relevantes de la escena de los últimos años.
El primer clip de “Transparente”, pertenece al tema “Buscar en Jah” y ya está rotando en las radios y los principales canales de música de todo el país.

El segundo corte de difusión, hoy sonando en las radios y principales cadenas musicales de television, es “Eso lo se muy bien…”

Para el 2013, a Dread Mar I le espera un año cargado de shows, en su mayoría en el exterior del país, donde ya estan confirmadas su presencia en dos de los festivales mas importantes de latinoamérica como es el Lollapalooza a realizarse en Chile y el Vive Latino en México.

1386,2128143,Stick Figure,None,None,None,"With a calming air of production prowess, Stick Figure is back with his newest album, World on Fire, released on August 30th, 2019. As with his previous releases, World on Fire was written, produced and recorded by Woodruff, a self-taught musician, this time at Stick Figure-owned Great Stone Studios in Oakland, CA, former home of Green Day. World on Fire is Stick Figure’s seventh album, and debuted as Billboard's #1 Independent Album (w/ SEA & TEA), #1 Reggae album, #4 Digital Album, #5 New Albums, #5 Daily Building Album, #6 Top Albums, #6 Current Albums, #8 Top Albums (w/ TEA) and #34 Top 200. The album went on to be the #1 selling reggae album of 2019 (Billboard) and has to date sold over 100,000 copies (w/ TEA & SEA, Nielsen). An intuitive and accomplished producer, Woodruff crafts authentic artistry from the foundation of roots-dub reggae, featuring cavernous grooves, sparkling electronic orchestration, and thick rhythms. His songs and sounds have evolved throughout time while staying true to his signature sound. World on Fire is undoubtedly Stick Figure’s best production to date, and the attention to detail throughout the album’s almost seventy minutes creates a top-notch sonic experience. Inside the historic studio, Stick Figure band member Johnny Cosmic, an accomplished producer in his own right, teams up with Woodruff to mix and master each track. When completed, a brotherhood of hard-jamming musicians delivers this widescreen soundtrack in concert performances of consciousness-altering emancipation. Preceding World on Fire, Stick Figure has released six albums, all recorded solo, with Woodruff laying down the tracks one by one. The current live band line-up features Kevin Bong (KBong) on keyboards, Kevin Offitzer on drums, bassist Tommy Suliman and Johnny Cosmic on guitar, keyboards, and backing vocals, with Scott upfront on guitar and vocals. Stick Figure concerts are gatherings distinguished by audience sing-alongs, hard hitting bass, extended improvisational interludes, the mind-manifesting hues of a light show, and the much-anticipated entrance of the band’s canine mascot, a rescued Australian Shepherd, Cocoa The Tour Dog, who has her own 501(c)3 charity and her own beer collaboration, the aptly named Cocoanut IPA. The show becomes a family gathering that spans across age and demographic, coming together for good vibes and musicAt a time that reggae is reaching new heights of popularity, the release of World on Fire signifies a coronation of sorts. There is no question that Woodruff’s distinct melodic subgenre has been solidified atop the scene’s pantheon.",True,California,None,65569,65,6,160,https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-4lTYVnNDffg2kt56-zZSmBQ-large.jpg,None,16,None,2021-08-13T04:03:29Z,2010-11-12T02:30:49Z

Other bands such as Korn, The Offspring, Avenged Sevenfold, and The Dirty Heads all have members that call this surfer’s paradise home.

Combining catchy choruses, heavy rock n’ roll guitar melodies, and smooth hip-hop and reggae rhythms are all significant characteristics that add to Pacific Dub’s coastal vibe, and genuine objective of creating innovative alternative-rock-reggae while sharing a message of love and peace.

From the entire Pacific Dub family, we thank you for your continued support, and look forward to releasing new music, and seeing you at a show soon.

Philosophy Talk is a weekly, one-hour radio series. The hosts' down-to-earth and no-nonsense approach brings the richness of philosophic thought to everyday subjects. Topics are lofty (Truth, Beauty, Justice), arresting (Terrorism, Intelligent Design, Suicide), and engaging (Baseball, Love, Happiness).

And of course, it’s about LOVE a subject we know is very important to you all! The programmes and discussions will be made and hosted by our own youth teams, speaking with you as peers about your lives and the situations you face every day, with a particular focus on sexual and reproductive health and rights.

The programmes will provide accurate, up-to-date and age-appropriate information on sexual and reproductive health and discuss topics such as relationships, safer sex, sexually transmitted infections and making healthy choices. It aims to improve your sexual reproductive health knowledge, increase awareness of your rights and reduce harmful sexual and reproductive practices. We want you to feel more confident to talk about these things with peers and sweethearts, and encourage you to find out more so that you can look after yourself and the ones you love.

A brand new format for the project is a TV comedy series, bringing back the characters from Loy9 Series three as they set up a café/bar and the relationships they have and problems they face. We’ll also have discussions, music, special guests and celebrities on the tv show and a radio phone-in and discussion show. Of course the project wouldn’t be complete without an interactive website and social media pages, so that we can hear from you directly and you can get involved, participate and share your experiences. We love to hear from you.

Love9 is produced by BBC Media Action and funded by UNFPA and USAID.

Long after America declared that was disco was dead it was still going strong in Melbourne, Australia where a young impressionable mind began soaking up everything disco had to offer. Butch le butch was born in a world where disco records were plentiful and the making of record/pause mixtapes was king.
After early forays into Melbourne’s house music scene, where Butch cut his teeth playing at various clubs such as The Lounge, 44 & Freakazoid, he found himself gravitating to music that was arm in arm with his disco roots. From deep throbbing bass lines to soaring string filled moments of ecstasy if the song was respectful to its disco roots it was right at home in Butch’s sets.
It wasn’t long before he turned his hand to remixing and re-edits where, along with producing tracks of his own, he reworked tracks by disco legends such as MFSB, The Trammps, Chic & Stephanie Mills as well as highly popular reworks of tracks by Dolly Parton, Madonna and the Jacksons.
With a penchant for all things disco from the serious to the senseless Butch’s sets are packed full of long forgotten gems and dared to be played boogie monsters.

I'm not going to talk about myself in the 3rd person. I'm not going to mention by name all the top DJ's worldwide who use my edits, nor am I going to repost all the amazing reviews I get regularly from major artists, producers, remixers and DJ's all over the world. Nope...not gonna do that.

What I will say is that my edits are done with an eye to the future. They are done with the utmost respect to the original track while also giving them just enough added elements to make them usable and Friendly for the modern DJ. 
My edits are created to be as genre-neutral as possible so that they can be used within a wide range of programming applications, allowing more DJ's to find them worthwhile additions to their working libraries.

The short of it is my edits work. They help breathe new life into classic tracks without taking away what made these songs amazing and fun to begin with.

1501,999652,Adde Instrumentals,Instagram:,@addeprod,Instagram: @addeprod,"Biography:

Sweden, may not be your first choice to find one of Dancehall’s top contending producers, but to Andreas Nilsson, it fits perfectly.

As a child of the eighties, growing up on a small island (""Sollerön"" in Dalarna) in Sweden, music became one if Andreas most avid companiosn. At the age of seven Andreas received his first synthesier/sampler, launching a lifelong passion into music production.

By highschool, Andreas (already known as Adde, from a childhood nickname), was already deep into music production. Testing the waters of his musical abilities, Andreas began deejaying, infusing his own creations within his sets.  in 2003, with the success of his productions, Andreas moved to Stockholm, Sweden and received his audio engineering diploma in 2005.

While Andreas credits all genres of music as influence, his muse can be found within Dancehall and hiphop. In 2011, Adde Instrumentals created the riddim for Dancehall icon Vybz Kartel’s biggest hit of the year, “Summer Time”, which was accompanied by Popcaan’s hit “Ravin”. Both singles received numerous international nods, weeks of #1 charting, and radio rotation; however, it was Kartel’s nomination for the 2011 Soul Train Awards that not only solidified Adde as a contender but garnered respect in the Dancehall community.

Adde Instrumentals also produced the instrumentals to several other hits for Vybz Kartel such as “Bike Back”, ""Open Up"", “Bubble Hard”  and “Dedication” which are all onfeatured on “Amsterdam EP”. Recently Adde built the ""Summer Wave riddim"" for TJ Records, a riddim which featured the huge hit ""When mi party"" by Popcaan,  ""Corner Shop riddim"" with JR Blender for 21St Hapilos productions, ""Happy Daze riddim"" for Fras Twinz, ""Sweet Sounds riddim"" with So Shifty,  ""BBQ riddim"" and is working on lots of upcoming riddims  and singles.
A strong believer in the quote, “Actions speak louder than words”, Andreas Nilsson (Adde Instrumentals), lets the music speak for him as he continues on his journey to create and share great music, touching the lives of artists and fans.",True,Stockholm,SE,23350,19,258,240,https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000047109337-rt2n6p-large.jpg,None,31,None,2021-05-31T16:46:43Z,2010-05-12T16:08:53Z

Jason's journey started at the age of 12, when playing around with samples on Tracker software turned into the uprise of his musical abilities. This led to creating 'Bubbling Remixes' of the hottest songs at the time and eventually his own 'Bubbling Beats'. From here on his love for Dancehall and Caribbean music blossomed, leading to a series of popular Remixes supported by many DJ's, Radio stations and TV programs. 

After a stream of music productions and gaining great support, Jason decided to take matters into his own hands to share his music with the world. Jason became a DJ of his own productions and has already rocked the stages at some of the biggest festivals in the Netherlands!
Jason has reached the Viral 50 charts on Spotify with his hit single “Gimme Punany” featuring dutch Dancehall artist Kalibwoy.

1610,4047103,Jenova 7,Michael J.,Sirois,Michael J. Sirois,"Jenova 7 is the musical “nom de plume” of Boston-based multimedia artist Michael J. Sirois (born 1989). His genres include trip-hop, downtempo, chill-out and instrumental hip-hop. He was featured on Mushroom Jazz 8, the latest volume of legendary DJ Mark Farina's iconic chillout compilation series.

He is most recognized for the “Dusted Jazz” instrumental series, distinct for exploring jazz grooves, organic drum breaks and moody, cinematic vibes. His style is influenced by the pioneering trip-hop artists of the 90s such as DJ Shadow, DJ Krush, DJ Cam and Portishead, as well as sample based Golden Era hip-hop producers such as DJ Premier and Pete Rock.

In late 2010, after graduating from college with a degree in film, he moved to Los Angeles for a year and started making music as “Jenova 7” with the trip-hop netlabel Dusted Wax Kingdom. In late 2013, he joined the Los Angeles based Cold Busted record label.

As a self-taught musician, his style has been inspired and guided by his versatile taste in music and his love for visual storytelling. Every album is meant to be the soundtrack to an imaginary film. His albums are a blend of the past and present—a mix of vintage crate digger samples accompanied by live instrumentation. His solo performances often feature original cinematic background visuals set behind simultaneous MPC beatmaking and improvised guitar playing.

He has collaborated with French trip-hop producer Hugo Kant and produced instrumentals for Craig G of the legendary Juice Crew hip-hop collective. He is also a member of the enigmatic trip-hop trio Wax Triptych, alongside fellow artists Mononome & Mr. Moods.

1759,72868468,Access Consciousness,None,None,None,"Access Consciousness offers pragmatic tools to change things in your life that you haven’t been able to change until now.

Access Consciousness provides you with ways to become totally aware and to begin to function as the conscious being you truly are.

Our target of Access is to create a world of Consciousness & Oneness

Consciousness & Oneness includes everything and judges nothing. It’s the ability to be present in your life in every moment without judgment of you or anyone else. It’s the ability to receive everything, to judge nothing, and to allow the entire Universe to be what it is. If you have no judgment of anything, then you get to look at everything for what it is, not for what you want it to be, not for what it ought to be, but just for what it is. From this space you can transform and change all things and create everything you desire in life – greater than what you currently have and more than what you can imagine.

Our target of Access is Empowerment

Everything in Access Consciousness is about empowering you with the awareness of the fact that you can perceive, know, be and receive everything infinitely. It’s about empowering you at all times to know that you know. As each one of us steps into our greatness, the possibility that gets created for all of us is infinitely greater.

Our target of Access is to Be You and Change the World.

You are capable of changing the world and changing everyone around you with the energy you can be. If you alone walk into a room full of panic-stricken people, panic can go away because of your energy, if you are willing to be it. But, you have to be willing to be that potent that nothing stops you as the consciousness you are.

What if you, being you, is the gift and change this world requires? Is now the time?

In India, he met his guru, Neem Karoli Baba, affectionately known as Maharajji, who gave Ram Dass his name, which means “servant of God.” Everything changed then – his intense dharmic life started, and he became a pivotal influence on a culture that has reverberated with the words “Be Here Now” ever since.

You must have, so others must know you are knowledgeable. The amount of education you've had nobody had before, no saint had it. So now take full advantage. Whatever your age may be, education qualification maybe, that doesn't matter, but you should all know what is Sahaja Yoga, what it means, how it works out.

This has taken me on a journey of trying to combine my love of exploring and documenting nature with my passion for recording and understanding sound. The idea has since manifested into a number of interesting projects and is in a constant state of evolution. I like the idea of using art as a way to understand the world of science, using imagination to explore scientific ideas beyond the limits of traditional scientific methodology.

I have built up the gear to record and capture sounds for use in films, interviews and music projects or you can check out the library of sounds. I have worked on a number of film projects in a number of different roles and enjoy working behind the camera, which has helped how I work with sound. I like being able to provide a different point of view and unique service for people who like the idea of thinking outside the box, because I live outside the box.

This has taken me on a journey of trying to combine my love of exploring and documenting nature with my passion for recording and understanding sound. The idea has since manifested into a number of interesting projects and is in a constant state of evolution. I like the idea of using art as a way to understand the world of science, using imagination to explore scientific ideas beyond the limits of traditional scientific methodology.

I have built up the gear to record and capture sounds for use in films, interviews and music projects or you can check out the library of sounds. I have worked on a number of film projects in a number of different roles and enjoy working behind the camera, which has helped how I work with sound. I like being able to provide a different point of view and unique service for people who like the idea of thinking outside the box, because I live outside the box. 

The most profound sound you will ever hear, is the sound when your heart breaks open

I have built up the gear to record and capture sounds for use in films, interviews and music projects or you can check out the library of sounds.
